In this example, the JavaScript code waits for the page to load (window.onload) and then finds the GIF element by its ID (autoplay-gif) and calls the play() method on it, which starts the animation.

Remember that the effectiveness of auto-play might still vary based on the platform and browser you're using. It's a good practice to provide a user-friendly experience that doesn't rely solely on auto-play functionality.
